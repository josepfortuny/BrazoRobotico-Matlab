# RoboticArm-Matlab

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that can monitor the patients
that sufers from Neuromuscular Disorders in the upper extremity's actions and
giving feedback to the doctor. To archive this goal we set certain objectives
that we had to archive:

* Implement a machine learning code that permits a user to create and
  implement automatically a classifcation of the movement without having
  any technological knowledge .
* Create an easy utilization and understanding interface that the doctor or
  the patient can use with the following options:
  * Visualize the physical responses that the arm of the user gives so
    that the doctor can see the muscles answers from the users biceps,
    triceps, position and strength.
  * Enable the doctor create a personalized training method that applies
    automatically the machine learning code implemented. This option
    has to include the possibility to take samples of the users response
    and add or erase them in case of need. This will enable the doctor
    adapt the rehabilitation exercises and therapy for each patient and
    get the response to each user action.
  * Create predefined trained sets of algorithm in order to distinguish
    actions that can be helpful in the training process or use the just
    created program from the doctor in the therapy session or in the
    users home.
  * Create a generic work
    ow Matlab application that can simplify and
    minimize the users actions.
